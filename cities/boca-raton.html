                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">At JAC Interiors, we believe that successful design projects are built on strong client collaboration. Our process begins with an initial consultation and design planning session, where we take the time to understand your vision, needs, and preferences.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">During this beginning phase, we discuss your goals, style preferences, and functional requirements, ensuring that every aspect of the design aligns with your lifestyle and expectations. This thorough understanding forms the foundation of our design plan tailored to your taste and requirements.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">To bring your vision to life, we utilize advanced 3D visualization tools that allow you to see your space transformed before any work begins. This technology provides a realistic preview of the proposed design, helping you make informed decisions and visualize the final outcome.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">We encourage client feedback and offer design revisions to ensure that every detail meets your approval. This iterative process ensures that the final design is a perfect reflection of your vision and preferences.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Once the design is finalized, our comprehensive project management and execution phase begins. Our experienced team oversees every aspect of the project, from sourcing materials and coordinating with contractors to managing timelines and budgets. We handle all the logistics, ensuring a seamless and stress-free experience for you.</p>
